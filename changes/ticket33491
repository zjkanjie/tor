  o Major bugfixes (DoS defenses, bridges, pluggable transport):
    - DoS subsystem was not given the transport name of the client connection
      when tor is a bridge and thus failing to find the GeoIP cache entry for
      that client address. This resulted in failing to apply DoS defenses on
      bridges with a pluggable transport. Fixes bug 33491; bugfix on
      0.3.3.2-alpha.
