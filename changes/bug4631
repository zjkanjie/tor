  o Minor bugfixes (directory authorities):
    - Directory authorities reject votes that arrive too late. In particular,
      once an authority has started fetching missing votes, it no longer
      accepts new votes posted by other authorities. This change helps prevent
      a consensus split, where only some authorities have the late vote.
      Fixes bug 4631; bugfix on 0.2.0.5-alpha.
