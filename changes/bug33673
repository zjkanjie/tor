  o Testing:
    - In our Appveyor Windows CI, copy required DLLs to test and app, before
      running tor's tests. This ensures that tor.exe and test*.exe use the
      correct version of each DLL. This fix is not required, but we hope it
      will avoid DLL search issues in future.
      Fixes bug 33673; bugfix on 0.3.4.2-alpha.
