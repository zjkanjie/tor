  o Removed features:
    - Remove the ClientAutoIPv6ORPort option. This option attempted
      to randomly choose between IPv4 and IPv6 for client connections,
      and isn't a true implementation of Happy Eyeballs. Often, this
      option failed on IPv4-only or IPv6-only connections. Closes
      ticket 32905. Patch by Neel Chauhan.
