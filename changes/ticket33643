  o Minor features (testing):
    - The unit tests now support a "TOR_SKIP_TESTCASES" environment variable
      to specify a list of space-separated test cases that should not be
      executed. We will use this to disable certain tests that are failing on
      Appveyor because of mismatched OpenSSL libraries. Part of ticket 33643.
